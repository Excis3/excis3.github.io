As security researchers, we often stumble upon vulnerabilities that have the potential to compromise systems and expose sensitive information. One such discovery is the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-30848, in Silversky's mailing protection service. This blog post details the discovery process, the vulnerability itself, and the disclosure timeline.


## Introduction
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are a common yet dangerous threat to web applications, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. On March 17, 2024, I discovered an XSS vulnerability in a hidden parameter named **version** within Silversky's mailing protection service. Despite multiple attempts to contact Silversky for remediation, the company has not responded.


## The Discovery
The journey to uncovering CVE-2024-30848 began quite unexpectedly. I got a message from my bug bounty framework that it had found an XSS. While reviewing the findings, I noticed that a particular program was using an external webmail service where the XSS was popping. Intrigued by this, I delved deeper into the service, which led me to discover that the service they were using was provided by Silversky. During this examination, I identified a hidden parameter named **version** that appeared to be vulnerable to XSS attacks.


## Technical Details
Silversky mailing service is a webmail service that they provide to various customers. However, the hidden **version** parameter within its web interface was susceptible to XSS. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially compromising the security of the users interacting with the service.


### Steps to Reproduce the Vulnerability
1. Access the Silversky mailing protection service web interface.
2. Locate the hidden **version** parameter in the HTTP request.
3. Inject a malicious script into the **version** parameter.
4. Observe the execution of the script when the webpage is loaded, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
